#+TITLE: A-SMUL Lib

* What is this about?
*A-SMUL*, stands for /A-Script/Markup Language/ is a work-in-progress 
programming language with two components; a markup language and a
scripting language. *A-SMUL Lib* is a library that provides a
parser, a compiler and a virtual machine for using A-SMUL.

* Goal
The main goal is to have natural compatablility in syntax between 
the scripting and the markup parts without additional delimeters,
all while providing sufficient performance comparable to Lua's and
ease of integration into written software. This normally requires 
a parser that is very highly context-sensitive.

* Progress
The tokenizer has already been written. A-SMUL Lib is being written 
in C++, and uses features upto C++17. You'll need a compiler that 
has support of =std::variant=. To compile the test file, clone the 
repository and then run *make tokenizer_test*, and then run the
binary generated in *testbins*. For most recent changes, check the
branch "devel".
